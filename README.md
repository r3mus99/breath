# 🌬️ Breath – A Minimal Breathing App

**Breath** is a lightweight and distraction-free breathing exercise app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
No frameworks. No dependencies. Just calm.

## ✨ About

This minimalist app was created with one goal:  
To bring a little peace into your day — through focused breathing — with as little visual and cognitive clutter as possible.

🧘‍♂️ **Two breathing exercises are included**:

1. **Balanced Breathing**  
   → 5.5s inhale · 5.5s exhale  
   Ideal for maintaining calm focus during a regular workday.

2. **Deep Calm**  
   → 4s inhale · 7s hold · 8s exhale  
   Designed for stressful moments when you need to slow down and reset.

The **only control** is a **cycle counter** — click it to reset.  
You can **bookmark** the app and use it anytime, anywhere. No tracking, no noise.

## 🛠️ Built With

## 🤍 Why

Sometimes, all you need is a breath.
